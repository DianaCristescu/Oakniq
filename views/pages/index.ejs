                            Heavily influenced by the Bauhaus movement and the works of Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier, the Mid-Century Modern interior design style focuses on clean lines, sleek curves and angles, futuristic yet simple forms, pops of retro-inspired colors, and abstract art.<br>—

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

                                &emsp;In a small workshop nestled in a quiet corner of town, Oakniq was born out of a passion for blending tradition with innovation. It all started with a fascination for mid-century design, the kind that evokes nostalgia while standing timelessly modern. The founders of Oakniq believed in the power of crafted objects—those that carry the warmth of the maker's hands, each item telling a story of intention, patience, and care.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;It began with wood and metal, materials that felt alive, honest, and grounding. Each piece of wood was chosen for its unique grains, each curve designed to enhance its natural beauty. The founders wanted to honor the organic nature of the materials but also bring them into the future, adding subtle elements of technology and modern utility. The result? Products that feel personal, unique, and inspiring—meant to fit seamlessly into people's homes, adding both style and soul.
